Overview:
Cat's Cradle is a game that my team and I created over the course of 2 weeks for the Jam-O-Lantern 2022 Game Jam. 
While we were a team of 5, I was the only programmer on the team. We created a demo and all of the systems were 
finished, but the levels beyond a demo level were never completed.

Notable Features:
 - 4 playable characters (Cat, Skull, Skeleton Upper Body, Full Skeleton).
 - Play as both the cat and skeleton, switching between them at will.
 - Physics  as the core of gameplay (swat props out of the way as the cat, climb vines and jungle gym across gaps 
   as the skeleton, leap with a point and click jump system as cat).
 - Dynamic music switches between character specific versions of each track when the character is changed.
 - Dialogue queueing system ensures every line is heard without overspeak.
